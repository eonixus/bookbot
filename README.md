# bookbot
**BookBot is my first project!**

This project is a Python script that processes a **.txt** document to analyze the following:
- The total number of words in the file.
- The frequency of each alphabet character, sorted from the most frequent to the least frequent.
- The project is currently configured to analyze a file named **frakenstain.txt**.

## Features
- **Word Counter**: Counts the total number of words in the document.
- **Alphabet Frequency Analysis**: Counts the occurrences of each alphabet (case-insensitive) and sorts them in descending order of frequency.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Designed for easy integration and minimal dependencies.
